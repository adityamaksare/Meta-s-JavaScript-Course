// Comparision between var let and const

// var keyword

/*
1. We can access a var variable before initialization..
as long as the var variable is EVENTUALLY INITIALIZED
...ANYWHERE in the code
*/

// 2. We can redeclare same variable without any errors

var user = "Marry"
var user = "Joanna"
var user = "Mark"  // the letest assigned value is stored in the variable
